	"bio": "Shigeru Miyamoto is a Japanese video game designer and producer. He is best known as the creator of some of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling video games of all time.\n\nMiyamoto originally joined Nintendo in 1977, when the company was beginning its foray into video games, and starting to abandon the playing cards it had made starting in 1889. His games have been seen on every Nintendo video game console, with his earliest work appearing on arcade machines in the late 70s. Franchises Miyamoto has helped create include the Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, F-Zero, Pikmin, and Wii series. Noteworthy games within these include Super Mario Bros., one of the most well known video games; Super Mario 64, an early example of 3D control schemes; and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, one of the most critically acclaimed video games of all time.",
