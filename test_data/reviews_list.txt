	"content": "This game is great. I got it when it was released. I personally love games where I get to create things. However, even though I got to. I had to unlock all the parts. The way to unlock the pieces was lame. You have to wait. Not sure if it was because of it being new. Or if it has changed. I don't know. But once you get all the pieces or not even having all the pieces. I can make some really good levels and upload lots of challenging ones. I made a maze level that is a huge hit.  It's great making a level and checking out later that 216 people played it. Commenting on it and giving it stars. Even if they hate it. It's still getting the word out that this level is fun. \r\nAs far as laying levels goes. I'm enjoying it way more than I expected. 100-Man Mario thing is great. Playing level after level. And skipping the ones that are just too crazy to complete. You have to complete your level to upload it. Which is fair. And having the music play over everything is great. My Xbox friends playing Evolve with Mario Theme playing over it. Ruins the scary aspect of their game meanwhile I'm cursing trying to get over a mountain of Goombas and Koopas.\r\n",
	"conclusion": "Overall, this game is probably one of the better Mario games out there. Lots fun to play and create.",

	"content": "This game was as great as Super Smash Bros. can get. The greatest thing this game had from the last two was a really good story. It was really cool. I thought it was the best. Then to add classic mode and all star mode in too. Plus stadium events and games. It was great. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay was great. It flowed nicely. It was clear. The changes they made were good and bad. New characters are always good. But cutting characters is a tough choice. Or changing a characters attacks. Mario's spin move for his down special attack was better than the Brawl version where he pulls FLUDD out and shoots water. It was just better in Melee. But the Smash Balls and Super Smashes was a neat new trick. It gave each character more uniqueness. \r\n\r\nAnd the other weapons are great. I didn't like the timers. I do and always will love the Fan. It's the best weapon in the game. My friends are terrified of me when I get the Fan. The soccer ball was neat. The Team Heal Ball was useless. We rarely played team games. So we never got to really use it. Assist Trophies and Poke Balls are fun. I did like collecting CDs. Trophy collecting is just there. And stickers were useless. They didn't seem to have that much of a purpose and you never know if you're close or not to collecting them all. \r\n\r\nThe stages were okay. A few stages bugged me so I keep them turned off. Custom Stages are really cool. I love custom stuff. So I have several of them. The music for the game was great. However, I personally don't like the Brawl theme as much as the original and Melee theme. \r\n\r\n100 Man Brawl is difficult. You can't turn off items. Which doesn't sound bad until you're at 15 and you have 200% damage. Then a bomb spawns right on top of you and you die instantly and lose all that progress. ",
	"conclusion": "So overall, this game is awesome. Not as awesome as Melee, but still awesome.",
