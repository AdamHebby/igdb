# Examples

Here you will find a few examples that make use of the igdb client to create
mini-applications. Each example demonstrates how to use some of the many 
services, options, or helper functions provided by the igdb client.

Every example is a self-contained mini-application that can be built and run
from the command line with a valid API key. 

If the examples do not sufficiently demonstrate how to use the service or
option you are interested in, please reference the [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/Henry-Sarabia/igdb)
which explains how each function works. In addition, there are a few trivial
[examples](https://godoc.org/github.com/Henry-Sarabia/igdb#pkg-examples) in the
documentation for each type of service function (under the Games service) and 
functional option.
